# IGM_Schiaparelli
Test setup for IGM Inversion at Schiaparelli Glacier

IGM Version: Current version of branch feature/hydra

I am having problems producing a reasonably velocity field with the Inversion. Therefore, with this parameter file I tried to only fit the velocity field and see if that would work.
